We will use the `-y` option to install without prompting the user for input, the `--name` option to name the enviornment for the tool. We will enforce versioning (`tool==version`) so that we know what version of a tool was used to do an analysis should we wish to repeat the analysis. \n",

In this case we are specifying to use tools compatible with Python 3.7 (a more up-to-date version than currently installed). We also add the `-c` command to tell conda that it can search for all the software [dependancies](https://askubuntu.com/questions/361741/what-are-dependencies) in the bioconda AND the conda-forge software repositories. \n"
